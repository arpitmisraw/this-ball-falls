## Rules:
1. The objective of the game is to keep the ball in the air for the longest duration of time possible.
2. Once the ball hits the 'ground', score resets to zero.
3. Additional points are awarded on successfully hitting the 'roof'.
4. Gravity inverts after every 10 successful clicks, after which the 'ground' and the 'roof' are interchanged.

## Features:
1. Radius changes after every click.
2. Gravity changes after 10 successful clicks.
3. Countdown for gravity change is displayed at the bottom (thank us later)
